# Wellness Pomodoro - A Developer Wellness Coach

## About The Project

Wellness Pomodoro is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to promote developer well-being by serving as an embedded wellness coach. Unlike traditional productivity tools that prioritize output, our focus is on sustaining developers' long-term health and career longevity through mindful work practices.

## Project Status

Currently in development. We are working on the initial implementation and welcome feedback on features that would best serve the developer community's wellness needs.

## Why This Matters

Traditional productivity tools often prioritize output over developer well-being. We believe that by focusing on the human experience of coding, we can help developers:
- Build sustainable, long-term coding careers
- Reduce burnout and fatigue
- Improve physical and mental health
- Maintain enthusiasm for their craft
- Create better work-life balance

Our goal is to transform how developers approach their daily work, making wellness an integral part of the coding experience rather than an afterthought.
